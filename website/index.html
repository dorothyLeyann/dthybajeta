        <h1 class="content">Introduction</h1>
        <pre class="content2"><strong>Dorothy Joy G. Bajeta, a young lady in her teenage years, has the following information provided below: </strong>

            Dorothy is a Student attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_Calapan">City College of Calapan</a> year 2024, in her first year taking <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system">Bachelor in Science and Information Systems.</a></em></a></pre>

        <h2 class="description">Appearance</h2>
        <pre class="description2">
            Dorothy with her unique appearance, she stood out from the crowd. A chubby frame was adorned with two small moles on her face, adding a touch of intrigue to her visage. 
            Her fashion sense leaned towards dark shirts, which she preferred over dresses, and her laughter often echoed through the air, even at the smallest of things. 
            Despite her friendly demeanor, she maintained a certain distance, allowing only a select few to venture deeper into her world.

            A walking contradiction, Dorothy's likes and dislikes often puzzled those around her. She was an avid reader, losing herself in the pages of various books, 
            and her talent for writing was unmatched. However, when she felt lazy, she would struggle to move, seeking comfort in her inertia. Dorothy's family life was
             as complex as her personality. She had an younger brother in the 8th grade, and her parents were not married. This led to a blended family with a larger 
             sibling group, including several brothers and sisters who shared her unconventional upbringing.
            
            As a bare minimum enjoyer, Dorothy was content to go with the flow of life, never seeking to disrupt the status quo. Her interest in Asian cultures piqued 
            her curiosity, and she spent hours practicing various stringed instruments, finding solace in their melodies. Her life was a beautiful blend of contradictions, 
            making her a fascinating character in the tapestry of her small house. <a href="portfolio.html">Want to know more?</a></pre>
